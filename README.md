## Overview

The CSE department has an initiative to hire more undergraduate students to serve as "readers" or "undergraduate Learning Assistants". Therefore, our senior design project will be to build a platform that facilitates the matching process of students and faculty/courses. The project would involve building a web-application that comes with the following features:

    - Allow faculty to request "ULA" positions for their course (post a position)
    - Allow students to apply for the position and enter relevant information
    - Allow faculty to select from a pool of interested students
    - Match faculty to undergraduate/graduate students based on the tasks appointed by the professor (i.e.: Grading papers, separating chemicals for a lab, dissecting frog brains for biological research, etc.)
